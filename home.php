<h1>Enjin Archives</h1></br>

  This is a site dedicated to the preservation of information about Enjin.com forums and its users.

  
This is a main page that has not been written yet. Since I have more or less forgotten all my HTML for now, it's not gonna have any formatting.</br>

<font=b> Except I'll try this. </b> </font> </br></br>
  
  <a href=http://enjin.com>As you can see, the site enjin.com now redirects to the bullshit cuntfest that is their crypto "business".</a> So, it's totally lost. Apart from the archives.
