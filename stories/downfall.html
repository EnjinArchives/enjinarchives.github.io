      Although Enjin officially shut down on 30 April 2023, the site had been in a downward spiral for quite a long time. The causes for this are numerous. Some of it is simply owed to economic and social factors, such as the consolidation of web traffic into a small number of social media sites; however, in this article, we will recap the non-economic factors. That is, what was unique to Enjin that went wrong?</br></br>

      <h3>The Beginning Of The End: Mineplex's Departure</h3>
      Mineplex was once the busiest Minecraft server worldwide. It had tens of thousands of users on at all times. Since their website was on Enjin, this was a major source of revenue and traffic for Enjin, and Enjin owed many of its active users to Mineplex's activity. What could go wrong? Well, naturally, when a business is overly dependent on one customer, the risk of running the business is high, as the customer could always leave if, say, the site is a breeding ground for monsters (mostly true in this case). So, what caused Mineplex to leave?</br></br>

      <h4>Staff Problems</h4>
      Mineplex was in its own downward spiral; arguably, this was the first root cause of the end of Enjin. In the mid-2010s, Mineplex dealt with multiple sex abuse scandals, involving staff members taking advantage of users who were minors. Naturally, this causes uproar on Enjin; the "riots" of those times were a response to these incidents.</br>
      The Enjin riots were simply</br>
      Ultimately, MP's inability to moderate its server led to many staff resignations, with users not wanting to be associated with MP, or not feeling it worthwhile to work for such an organization for free anymore.</br>

      <h4>User Problems</h4>
      The other fundamental factor that initiated the downfall of Mineplex was the fact that its user base was a cancerous cesspool consisting of angsty, vengeance-seeking, retarded skids (often pulling amusing stunts) fighting against mentally dim loser kids who ruined what could have been a thriving community with their stupidity. This is bound to happen in any poorly moderated, highly welcoming online community populated by teenagers and kids, as (highly disinhibited) factions will naturally form among these groups and result in fighting. In any online anarchy, whoever has the better hacking/doxing chops will inevitably defeat the bird-brains. Mineplex's mistake (if you consider allowing this entertainment to go on for years to be a mistake) was to continue to allow as much free speech as they did, opening themselves up to further liability, such as users being spammed with obscene content. This was a bad thing for them.</br>
      In fact, there were many sources of fighting in the MP community (as well as Enjin at large). This included interpersonal conflicts, such as those resulting from users faking their own deaths; and naturally, given the environemnt of the mid-2010s and later, endless political bickering, with opinions ranging from communist to, more prominently, white supremacy.</br> 
      
      <h4>Resorting To Ponzi Scehemes: Enjincoin</h4>

      <h4>The Last Nail In The Coffin: Autcraft</h4>
      After Mineplex left, what remained? Aside from a few small, insignificant communities, all that remained was Autcraft.

      Autcraft is a whitelisted Minecraft server run by Stuart Duncan (AKA @autismfather on X, formerly known as Twitter), an autistic father of an autistic son who created a server for autists.
