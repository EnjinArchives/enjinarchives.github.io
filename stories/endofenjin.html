      Enjin announced, via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230425064004/https://www.enjin.com/forums/m/10826/viewthread/33743439-announcing-retirement-enjin-website-builder">this post made January 2023</a>, that the site builder would be shut down as of 30 April 2023. This was obviously stupid, as they were switching over from their original business to their <a href="http://enjin.io">crypto bullshit</a> business.</br></br>
    
    Many users asked if they would be allowed to export their site data. However, Enjin was largely unresponsive, deciding to nuke the entire website without giving anyone a way to download their data. We do not know the status of this data. However, by this point, the site was mostly dead; there were almost 200 replies to Enjin's shutdown post, but this is a trifling number compared to the activity that used to exist. This is because, as will be described on separate history pages, Mineplex, Autcraft, and other major sites had left Enjin already. Enjin had reached close to 18 million users by the time of its shutdown. A few users returned towards the end to see it off before it shut down, but most users did not.</br></br>

      Enjin did shut down on 30 April 2023; however, they shut down hours before they promised they would.</br></br>
      
      Fortunately, some users saved a lot of pages on Archive.org, so some communities have been partially preserved.</br></br>
