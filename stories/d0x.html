      Alright, you bastards.</br></br>

      Listen here. It is no secret that Enjin was full of doxing, IRL leaking, and personal harassment of other types. If you were on the site long enough, you saw it a lot.</br></br>

      However, it's really not much of a mystery why all this happened. Most of you were so bad with your personal information that you made it no challenge at all for anyone to dox you.</br></br>

      Here is a list of "Do"s and "Don't"s for protecting your privacy on Enjin.</br></br>

      <h2>Do:</h2>

      <h2>Don't:</h2>
