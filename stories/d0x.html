      Alright, you bastards.</br></br>

      Listen here. It is no secret that Enjin was full of doxing, IRL leaking, and personal harassment of other types. If you were on the site long enough, you saw it a lot.</br></br>

      However, it's really not much of a mystery why all this happened. Most of you were so bad with your personal information that you made it no challenge at all for anyone to dox you.</br></br>

      Here is a list of things to avoid if you want to protect your privacy on Enjin.</br></br>
      <h2>Don't:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Post any photos of yourself. I mean, this should be obvious, but for some reason it wasn't. Everything you put online is permanent. You think doxxers will be forgiving and forget it? No, it's going into an archive. Don't post pictures of you with your friends where any faces are blurred out either.
  </li>
  <li>
    Post any photos taken inside your house, especially if a window or door or other distinctive architectural feature is shown. You are begging to be identified via Google Street View.
  </li>
  <li>
    Answer any questions that pertain to: where you live, where you go to school/work, events in your area, distinctive qualities of your country/state/city/region, or the same about any family member or friend of yours.
  </li>
  <li>
    Share any other social media information.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use your real name, even if it's your first name.
  </li>
  <li>
    Put your birth year in your username, or <i>anywhere</i> on the site.
  </li>
  <li>
    Announce when it's your birthday.
  </li>
  <li>
    Share any of the above information <i>with anyone you do not trust with your and your family's address, phone number, emails, and social media information.</i> Hey, if you trust them, go for it. Just know they could get all that information if they want.
  </li>
  <li>
    Trust an IRL leaker to remove your IRL if you provide another one as proof that it is you asking. The leaker will probably just post that one too.
  </li>
  <li>
    Open any direct messages from people you don't know. Use your instincts. You could get IP-logged.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fall for any website-spoofing scheme. Only type your password into the website if the URL is correct in your URL bar. Otherwise, you may be giving you password away to a stranger.
  </li>
</ul>
