Mineplex was founded on January 24, 2013, by Gregory Bylos (Sterling_) and Jarred van de Voort (Spu_). It was a popular Minecraft minigame server that offered various unique and engaging games for players to enjoy.

At its peak, Mineplex boasted millions of unique players monthly and held the Guinness World Record for most concurrent players on a Minecraft server (34,434 players in 2015). While its popularity has declined in recent years, it remains a significant part of Minecraft server history.

Here are some additional details:

    The server initially focused on hosting the creators' minigame, Castle Siege, and later added Bridges.
    In June 2013, they merged with the Minecraft server BetterMC, expanding their game selection and staff.
    YouTuber CaptainSparklez joined the ownership team in 2014, contributing to the server's significant growth.
    While initially primarily on the Java Edition of Minecraft, Mineplex also offered a Bedrock Edition server.
    In late 2023, Mineplex announced a significant shift in focus, transitioning from a server to a platform for aspiring game developers.
