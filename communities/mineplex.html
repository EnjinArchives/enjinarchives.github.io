  <h1>Mineplex: Minigame Server and Drama Platform</h1>

  <p>Mineplex, once a Minecraft minigame server that captivated millions, has undergone a remarkable transformation. Let's delve into its history.</p>

  <h2>Humble Beginnings (2013)</h2>

  <p>On January 24, 2013, a spark ignited the world of Minecraft servers. Gregory Bylos (Sterling_) and Jarred van de Voort (Spu_) birthed Mineplex out of their assholes, initially built around their innovative game "Castle Siege." Soon, another popular game, "Bridges," joined the roster.</p>

  <h2>Merging and Expanding (2013)</h2>

  <p>Just months later, in June 2013, Mineplex merged with the established "BetterMC" server, significantly expanding its game library and staff. This marked a turning point, solidifying Mineplex's presence in the Minecraft server landscape.</p>

  <h2>The Captain Joins the Crew (2014)</h2>

  <p>2014 witnessed a major boost for Mineplex with the arrival of popular YouTuber CaptainSparklez as part of the ownership team. His influence and reach contributed significantly to the server's explosive growth, attracting even more players.</p>

<p>At its peak, Mineplex boasted millions of unique players monthly and held the Guinness World Record for most concurrent players on a Minecraft server (34,434 players in 2015).</p>
